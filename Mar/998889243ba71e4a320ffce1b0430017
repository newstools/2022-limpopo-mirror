Following his accreditation to officiate at international level early this year, a local soccer referee, Mr Jelly Chavani, had his first assignment in Mauritius on Wednesday. The 26-year-old Chavani flew to Mauritius on Monday morning. He was the referee in the African Cup of Nations (AFCON) elimination-round match between Mauritius and Seychelles, which was played at the Anjalay Stadium. During an interview with him shortly before he left for the subtropical island, the diminutive match official revealed that he could not wait to blow the whistle for the first time at international level. Asked whether he was nervous since this was his first experience, the Premier Soccer League’s best referee in the 2019/20 season said that he had nothing to fear. He revealed that he was fit, both mentally and physically, adding that he was ready to absorb the pressure that goes with officiating at international level. Mr Chavani said that officiating at international level was a great achievement to him. He added that his last target was to officiate in a World Cup final game, something that he hoped to achieve within the next five years. Chavani started blowing the whistle at local football association (LFA) level about nine years ago. Following his superb performance at the both the LFA and regional level between 2013 and 2015, Chavani was promoted to officiate at professional level in the middle of the 2015/16 soccer season. He only got to officiate a few National First Division matches that season. After excelling in the NFD games, Chavani was given the thumbs-up to officiate during the PSL matches as well. Due to his ability to absorb the heat that goes with officiating at big games, Chavani was tasked to officiate in crucial matches, including the Soweto derbies between Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates and a number of cup-final games over the past years.
