The Mulaudzi family from Dzwerani-Hakhangale village, just outside Thohoyandou, were left devastated when their handicapped son died after a fire broke out in their 10-room house last Tuesday morning (31 May). According to acting Vhembe police spokesperson Sgt Vuledzani Dathi, the Mulaudzi couple left their handicapped 23-year-old twin sons, Ngaahule and Akonisaho, home sleeping when they went to work at around 05:30 on the morning of the incident. When the family’s domestic worker, Ms Rosinah Masala, arrived for work, she found that the house was on fire and shouted for help. Neighbours ran to the scene to help, breaking the burglar-proofed door, so that they could get into the house. Akonisaho managed to escape the fire and ran out of the house unharmed, but despite their efforts to rescue Ngaahule, they were too late as the fire had already spread to all the bedrooms. Dathi said the police were on their daily patrol duties when they were alerted about a certain house in the village that was on fire and went to investigate. Ngaahule was certified dead at the scene, burnt beyond recognition. The deceased’s body was taken to the Elim government mortuary for an autopsy and for further police investigation. Dathi said the cause of the fire was still unknown, but that an electrical fault could not be ruled out. Ngaahule’s parents, Mr Shumani Erick Mulaudzi, and his wife, Josephine, who are both teachers at different primary schools, are still in a state of shock after the incident. “We understand that we will all die one day, but Ngaahule died a terrible death. It has left a deep, aching void inside our hearts. However, we are thankful to the Dzwerani community who came in large numbers and bravely saved some of the house’s contents by carrying them out before everything could be engulfed by the fire. They even helped to clean the house afterwards,” said Mulaudzi.
