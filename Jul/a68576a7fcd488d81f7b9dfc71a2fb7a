The body of 50-year-old Eric Dovhani Nedzamba from Ha-Khakhu village near Nzhelele, who was reported missing by worried family members, was found in Lake Fundudzi. According to the chairperson of the sub-council, Mr Lufuno Mavhase, Eric started having suicidal tendencies about three weeks ago, when he told his relatives that he was going to throw himself in a nearby lake. He said that community members followed the troubled man and stopped him from getting into the water. After that, Nedzamba spent a whole week at his brother’s place. “On Saturday (2 July), he went missing again. The following day (Sunday), the community members were alerted and everyone started to look for him. The police came on Tuesday (5 July), and his clothes were found on the bank of the lake. Police divers arrived the next day and went into the lake, where his lifeless body was found,” Mavhase said. The incident was confirmed by the police spokesperson in Vhembe, Sergeant Tshifhiwa Radzilani. Nedzamba was buried on Tuesday, 12 July.
